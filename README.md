1. Open `src/loanData.json`
2. Add a new loan object to the `loans` array:

```json
{
  "id": 21,                    // Unique ID
  "lender": "X",               // Lender code (single letter recommended)
  "type": "30yr Fixed",        // Loan type (e.g., "30yr Fixed", "15yr Fixed", "7/6 ARM")
  "rate": 6.250,               // Annual interest rate as decimal (6.25% = 6.250)
  "downPct": 20,               // Down payment percentage
  "closingCosts": 25000,       // Total closing costs
  "lenderFees": 1500,          // Lender origination fees
  "pointsFees": 5000,          // Discount points cost
  "thirdPartyFees": 15000,     // Third party fees (title, appraisal, etc.)
  "negotiableFees": 3500,      // Potentially negotiable fees
  "extra10Pct": false          // Optional: for special loan types
}
```

## Using the Calculator

### Basic Usage

1. **Set Purchase Price**: Enter the home purchase price
2. **Choose Payoff Strategy**: Select how quickly you want to pay off the loan
3. **Configure Payments**:
   - Year 1 Principal: Extra lump sum payment in first year
   - Additional Monthly: Extra amount paid each month
4. **Filter Options**:
   - Down Payment: Show only loans with specific down payments
   - Use checkboxes to select multiple down payment options

### Advanced Features

#### Equal Monthly Payments
Enable "Auto-adjust for equal monthly payments" to calculate the exact monthly payment needed to pay off each loan in your target timeframe. This shows the true cost comparison when all loans are paid with equal monthly payments.

#### Quarterly Chunks
Enable "Use Quarterly Chunks" to model paying extra principal in quarterly lump sums instead of monthly. This can be useful for bonus-based compensation.

#### Understanding the Results

- **Green rows**: Best options based on total cost
- **Blue rows**: Top 5 options
- **Monthly (Equal)**: Shows when equal payment mode is active
- **Points Break Even**: Time to recoup points cost (red if longer than payoff)
- **Actual Payoff**: When the loan actually pays off with your payment strategy

### Column Explanations

- **Rank**: Overall ranking by total cost
- **Monthly**: Required monthly payment (may show base + extra)
- **+Extra**: Additional principal payment per month
- **Quarterly**: Quarterly principal payment (if enabled)
- **Total Interest**: Total interest paid over loan life
- **Total Cost**: Total interest + closing costs
- **vs Best**: Difference from the lowest cost option
- **Points Break Even**: Months to recoup points investment
